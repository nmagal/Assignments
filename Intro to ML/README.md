# Introduction to Machine Learning  
Please find below coding assignment descriptions for Introduction to Machine Learning, 10601 CMU. All of these assignments were implemented in python with the help of numpy. The assignments were:

## Classification Decision Tree 
In this assignment, a binary classification decision tree was created. In order to accomplish this, a tree was recursively created that chose the attribute to split on by finding the attribute with the highest mutual information. 

## Neural Network
In this assignment, a classification neural network was created. Forward and backward pass are both implemented, and weights are updated using SGD. 

##Gaussian Naive Bayes
In this assignment, gaussian naive bayes is used to predict the word stimulus given a human subject's neural activity measured by fMRI.  Using the naive assumption of conditional independence given a class label, we are able to achieve respectable results. 

## Q-learning with Linear Function Approximation 
In this assignment, q-learning with linear function approximation is used to solve the mountain car problem. The goal is to obtain the optimal polices and action values to allow the car to make it up hill only using gravity and momentum.
