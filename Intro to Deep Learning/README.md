# Introduction to Deep Learning 

Below contains coding assignment descriptions for Intro to Deep Learning. The coding assignments can be divided into two components, numpy implementations of a deep learning architectures and pytorch implementations of deep learning architectures.

## Pytorch Implementations 

### Neural Network
Kaggle Challenge: [Frame level classification of speech](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/11-785-s20-hw1p2/overview). In this assignment, a neural network is created for frame level classification of speech. Data is given in the form of raw mel spectrogram frames, and our predictions are phoneme state labels.


## Numpy Implementations 

### Neural Network
In this assignment, a neural network is created. Linear layers, activation functions, backprop, batchnorm, and momentum are implemented.

### Convolutional Neural Network
In this assignment, a convolutional nueral network is created. This builds upon the previous assignment, and 1D and 2D convolutional layers are implemented.
