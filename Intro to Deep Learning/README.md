# Introduction to Deep Learning 

Below contains coding assignment descriptions for Intro to Deep Learning. The coding assignments can be divided into two components, numpy implementations of deep learning architectures and pytorch implementations of deep learning architectures.

## Pytorch Implementations 

### Neural Network
In this assignment, a vanilla neural network is created for frame level classification of speech. Data is given in the form of raw mel spectrogram frames, and our predictions are frame level phoneme labels.
